# hebbian-net
Hebbian-Net is an innovative neural network framework inspired by the Hebbian learning rule, which was first proposed by Donald Hebb in 1949. This repository aims to simulate the self-organizing and adaptive properties of biological neural networks using simple yet powerful algorithms based on Hebbian principles.

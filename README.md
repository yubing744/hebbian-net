# Hebbian-Net

Hebbian-Net is an innovative neural network framework inspired by the Hebbian learning rule, which was first proposed by Donald Hebb in 1949. This repository aims to simulate the self-organizing and adaptive properties of biological neural networks using simple yet powerful algorithms based on Hebbian principles.

## Overview

Hebbian learning rule, often summarized as "Cells that fire together, wire together," is a fundamental mechanism for synaptic plasticity and learning in the brain. Hebbian-Net leverages this principle to create a neural network that can learn and adapt from its inputs without the need for labeled data, making it a robust tool for unsupervised learning.

## Features

- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**: Utilizes Hebbian learning to create self-organizing maps that can cluster and visualize high-dimensional data.
- **Competitive Learning**: Implements competitive learning mechanisms to enhance the differentiation and specialization of neurons.
- **Modular Architecture**: Supports modular design to simulate different functional regions of the brain, enabling complex tasks through collaboration between modules.
- **Scalable Design**: Horizontally and vertically scalable to handle various data types and sizes.
